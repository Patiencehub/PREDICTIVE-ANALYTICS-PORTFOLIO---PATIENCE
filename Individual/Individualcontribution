I contributed most strongly to the machine learning modeling process, especially building and refining the XGBoost churn prediction model and validating performance using AUC and SHAP analysis.

One approach I advocated for was using XGBoost rather than relying only on logistic regression because it captured nonlinear relationships and improved predictive accuracy.

One lesson learned was the importance of clean feature engineering and validating assumptions early. If given more time, I would improve model calibration and build a simple dashboard for business users.
