Churn predictions do not need to be instant. Overnight batch scoring is sufficient because retention campaigns are typically planned in advance.

The model would run weekly and save results into a database table that feeds a dashboard used by marketing and customer success teams.

A scheduled Python process using SQL data extraction would be used.

To maintain trust:
- Data quality check: verify customer counts and missing values
- Input drift check: monitor if monthly fee distribution changes significantly
- Outcome check: track actual churn vs predicted churn over time
